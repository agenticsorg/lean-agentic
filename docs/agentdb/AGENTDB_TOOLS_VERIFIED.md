## Integration with lean-agentic

### Use Case: Theorem Proving with Learning

```javascript
// 1. Initialize AgentDB
await agentdb_init({ db_path: "./theorems.db" });

// 2. Store theorem-proving pattern
await agentdb_pattern_store({
  taskType: "theorem-proving",
  approach: "Use lambda abstraction with dependent types",
  successRate: 0.95
});

// 3. Start RL session
const session = await learning_start_session({
  user_id: "prover-1",
  session_type: "q-learning",
  config: { learning_rate: 0.01, discount_factor: 0.99 }
});

// 4. Get AI recommendation
const action = await learning_predict({
  session_id: session.id,
  state: "Need to prove: ∀A, A → A"
});

// 5. Execute with lean-agentic
const result = leanAgentic.prove(action.recommended_action);

// 6. Provide feedback
await learning_feedback({
  session_id: session.id,
  state: "Need to prove: ∀A, A → A",
  action: action.recommended_action,
  reward: result.success ? 0.95 : 0.0,
  success: result.success
});

// 7. Train and improve
await learning_train({
  session_id: session.id,
  epochs: 50,
  batch_size: 32
});
```

### Use Case: Performance Optimization Memory

```javascript
// Store causal knowledge
await causal_add_edge({
  cause: "Enable hash-consing in arena",
  effect: "150x faster term equality checks",
  uplift: 149,
  confidence: 0.99,
  sample_size: 1000
});

// Create optimization skill
await skill_create({
  name: "hash_consing_optimization",
  description: "Use hash-consing for O(1) term equality",
  code: "arena.intern(term)",
  success_rate: 0.98
});

// Search for optimization techniques
const skills = await skill_search({
  task: "Optimize term equality performance",
  min_success_rate: 0.9
});
// Returns: hash_consing_optimization (98% success)
```
