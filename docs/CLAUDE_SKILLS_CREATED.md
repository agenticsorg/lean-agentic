## How Claude Will Use These Skills

### Autonomous Discovery

Claude will automatically match these skills when users ask:

**lean-agentic skill triggers:**
- "How do I prove theorems in JavaScript?"
- "Type check this code with dependent types"
- "Use lean-agentic to verify correctness"
- "What is hash-consing?"
- "Build a theorem prover"

**agentdb-lean-agentic skill triggers:**
- "Make my theorem prover learn from experience"
- "Build self-improving AI"
- "Integrate AgentDB with lean-agentic"
- "How does reinforcement learning work for proofs?"
- "Create adaptive verification system"

### Progressive Loading

**Phase 1:** Claude reads name + description (~200 chars each)
- Decides if skill is relevant
- Minimal context usage

**Phase 2:** If triggered, loads SKILL.md body (~15-20KB)
- Reads Quick Start section first
- Follows step-by-step if needed
- Accesses advanced sections on demand

**Phase 3:** If needed, loads referenced files
- `basic-usage.js` example
- `self-improving-prover.js` example
- Additional docs (when created)

**Total Context:** Only active skill content loaded (~15-20KB max)

---

## Example Usage

### User asks: "How do I use lean-agentic?"

**Claude's Process:**
1. Scans installed skills (name + description)
2. Matches "lean-agentic Theorem Prover" skill
3. Loads SKILL.md content
4. Reads Quick Start section
5. Provides 60-second example

**Response:**
```javascript
// From lean-agentic skill Quick Start
const { LeanAgentic } = require('lean-agentic/node');

const demo = LeanAgentic.createDemo();
const result = demo.createIdentity();
console.log(result); // λx:Type. x : Π(A:Type). A → A
```

### User asks: "Make it learn from experience"

**Claude's Process:**
1. Scans skills again
2. Matches "AgentDB + lean-agentic Integration" skill
3. Loads integration SKILL.md
4. Provides self-improving example

**Response:**
```javascript
// From agentdb-lean-agentic skill
const session = await db.learning_start_session({
  user_id: 'prover',
  session_type: 'ppo'
});

// AI learns from every attempt
// Success rate: 30% → 95%
```
