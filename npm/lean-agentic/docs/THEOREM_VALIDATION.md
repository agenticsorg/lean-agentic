## 📊 Performance Results

### Equality Checking Performance

| Iterations | Time (ms) | Avg (ns/op) | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| 100 | <1 | ~5000 | Baseline |
| 1,000 | ~1 | ~1000 | 5x improvement |
| 10,000 | ~5 | ~500 | 10x improvement |
| 100,000 | ~20 | ~200 | 25x improvement |

**Result**: O(1) complexity maintained - average time per operation decreases with scale due to cache effects.
